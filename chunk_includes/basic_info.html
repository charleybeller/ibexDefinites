<h3>Basic Information about you</h3>
<p>We would like to know some basic information about you and where you live, because language varies to some extent across speakers of different ages, genders, and states. You are not required to answer these questions, but it will help our study if you do.</p>
<p>What is your gender? <input type="radio" value="1" name="gender" /><span class="answertext">Female<input type="radio" value="0" name="gender" /><span class="answertext">Male</span></span></p>
<p>What is your age? <input type="text" name="Age" id="age" size="20" /></p>
<p>Which state did you grow up in (two letter abbreviation)? <input type="text" name="StateGU" id="state_gu" size="20" /></p>
