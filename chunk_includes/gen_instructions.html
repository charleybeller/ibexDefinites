  for two expressions to refer to the same person.

 <p> 
  We are interested in your personal judgment on this matter so there are no wrong or right answers.

<ul>
  <li>  If you think that the indicated expressions can refer to the same person, then you should give the sentence a high rating (6 or 7). </li>
<li>  If you think that they cannot then you should give the sentence a low rating (1 or 2). </li>
<li>  Sometimes it may not be totally acceptable or totally unacceptable for the indicated expressions to refer to the same person,
  you could give those a more intermediate rating (3-5).</li>
