<div style="width: 40em;">
<p>
In this task we would like you to judge whether it is possible
  for two expressions, presented in <b>boldface</b>, to refer to the same person.
  </p>
 <p> 
  We are interested in your personal judgment on this matter so there are no wrong or right answers.
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>  If you think that the bolded expressions can refer to the same person, then you should give the sentence a high rating (6 or 7). </li>
<li>  If you think that they cannot then you should give the sentence a low rating (1 or 2). </li>
<li>  Sometimes it may not be totally acceptable or totally unacceptable for the bolded expressions to refer to the same person,
  you could give those a more intermediate rating (3-5).</li>
</ul>
