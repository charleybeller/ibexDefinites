  The previous two example sentences, repeated below, share most of the same words while
  having different coreference possibilites. 
  
  
  <ol> 
    <li><span class=dp>Mary</span> saw <span class=dp>herself</span> in the mirror.</li>
    <li><span class=dp>Mary</span> saw <span class=dp>her</span> in the mirror.</li>
  </ol>

 Some of the sentences you will be asked to rate will look similar to one another
  but none of them are exactly the same.

  Please read and rate each one individually, as even similar sentences may have completely different
coreference patterns.
