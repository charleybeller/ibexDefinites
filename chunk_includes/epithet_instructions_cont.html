   Sometimes sentences that look superficially similar have very different different coreference possibilites.
   The two sentences below have almost the same words; but according to the judgments of many speakers
  the bolded expressions in (1.) must refer to the same person, while the bolded expressions in (2.) cannot.
  
  <ol> 
    <li><b>Mary</b> saw <b>herself</b> in the mirror.</li>
    <li><b>Mary</b> saw <b>her</b> in the mirror.</li>
  </ol>

 Some of the sentences you will be asked to rate will look similar to one another
  but none of them are exactly the same.
<br><br>  
  Please read and rate each one individually, as even similar sentences may have completely different
coreference patterns.
